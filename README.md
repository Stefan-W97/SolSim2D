SolSim 2D

I started with Python about three months ago and this is my first bigger project. 
Many thanks to my coach Sven, who helped me a lot with bugfixing and some of the more difficult numpy functions.

I used pygame for the interface and numpy for some mathematical stuff like coordinates.

The features are:

- Moving arround (for example to see further planets )

- Speed-Changes

- Show and hide information stuff like orbits, menues and names

- Destroy planets (or the sun)

- Create own planets with own speed, ow mass and own distance.

The simulation is further able to:

- Simulate gravitational forces

- Simulate collissions

- Draw the orbits and the previous movement of the planets

The biggest programming-chalenges where

- Drawing the orbit with acceptable performance, especially after the user updated the picture.

- Implementing the creation-functions. I had to simplyfy on a few places to keep a good overview.
